# Workflow-Manager
As part of our Computer Science Lecture, we created a Java based App over the timespan of a month. 
The App is created as a reallife helping utility to manage Working Hours and create ToDoLists or Projects.

We collaborated over a seperate Private Github Repo, but decided to publish it seperately in this Clean Repository :)

Have fun !
